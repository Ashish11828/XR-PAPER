XR RESEARCH PAPER ON THE XR AND AI
🤖 Sign Language AI & XR
Bridging Communication with Artificial Intelligence and Extended Reality

Welcome to the Sign Language AI & XR project — an innovative platform that combines Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Vision, and Extended Reality (XR) (AR/VR) to enhance communication between deaf and hearing communities.

This project explores how AI-powered gesture recognition and immersive XR environments can be used to translate sign language in real time, visualize gestures in 3D, and create interactive learning experiences for users and educators alike.

🚀 Key Features

🧠 AI-Based Sign Recognition — Uses deep learning models (CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers) for real-time gesture detection.

🎮 XR Integration — Visualizes signs and gestures in AR/VR environments for immersive training and interaction.

📱 Cross-Platform Support — Designed for web, mobile, and XR devices (Meta Quest, HoloLens, etc.).

🌐 Multilingual Dataset — Supports ASL, BSL, ISL, and other sign languages for inclusive communication.

🔊 Speech & Text Translation — Converts recognized signs into spoken or written language.

🧩 Tech Stack

AI/ML Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Mediapipe

XR Tools: Unity, Unreal Engine, WebXR

Languages: Python, C#, JavaScript

APIs: OpenCV, MediaPipe, OpenXR, Speech-to-Text

🎯 Project Goals

Build an open-source AI model for real-time sign language translation.

Create an immersive XR learning environment for sign language education.

Promote accessibility and inclusivity through advanced technology.

📚 Research Context
